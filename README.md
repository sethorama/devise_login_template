# Devise Login Template

Just a basic login template using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) and [Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) with [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) for signing up with Facebook.

Will be using [rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) with [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) for tests.

I have set u using [Mysql2](https://www.mysql.com/) for the database.

To get up and running:
* Clone the rpository
